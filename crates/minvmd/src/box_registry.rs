//! The host-side table of every published namespace (NET-138) — the rows the
//! VM host daemon's egress gate decides by (NET-081).
//!
//! On a VM-backed host the guest cannot be trusted to say what its boxes may
//! reach: the in-VM daemon is *inside* the escape boundary, and a process
//! that breaks out of a box into the VM controls it. The per-box,
//! source-addressed egress rules NET-081 asks for therefore live **outside**
//! the VM, in `minvmd`, applied by [`crate::net::egress_gate`] between the
//! guest's shuttle and the switch socket. This module is the table that gate
//! reads: one row per published namespace, holding its name, its addresses on
//! the switch and on the loopback, the ports it admitted, the names it
//! declared, and its compiled [`EgressRules`] — the rules the gate decides
//! every frame by, the same set the in-guest relay applies, now held where
//! nothing inside the VM can change it. The publish half of the gate
//! (NET-081's control verbs) reads the row's ports and names as the records
//! it will admit a switch publish for; the frame half reads the rules alone.
//!
//! The trust boundary is the type boundary. Rows are filled **in this
//! process**, from the host side — the host's own derivation of the guest
//! node's namespace ([`BoxRegistry::register_node_namespace`]), and the
//! client's box declarations carried over the host's control path — and never
//! from anything the guest says. The gate is handed a [`BoxTable`], the
//! read-only view whose only row operations are lookups, so the one component
//! that reads guest frames cannot add, replace, or withdraw a row. The
//! registration path that carries a client's box declarations into this
//! registry is T66's; what lands here is the table's shape, the gate that
//! reads it, and the rows the host itself can name.
